Sort Motion.vim
===============

Sort lines of text using motions and text objects. By default `sort-motion`
is mapped to `<leader>so`, so sorting a paragraph of text can be accomplished
with `<leader>soap`. Both funny to type, and easy to remember!

Installation
------------

Using [Vundle][]:

``` vim
" add this line to your ~/.vimrc
Bundle 'christoomey/vim-sort-motion'
```

then run `:BundleInstall` from within Vim.
